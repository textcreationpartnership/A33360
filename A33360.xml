            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>THE Reputation of preſcribed Liturgies depends on their ſuppoſed Antiquity; this is their great, their beſt ſupport. They pretend not to Scripture, nor will their Advocates maintain, that the Apoſtles either uſed ſuch, or left any order for the compoſing and preſcribing of them.</p>
               <p>And it will ſeem ſtrange to thoſe that reverence Antiquity, that good Reaſon ſhould be found for them; if the Antients for four or five Ages could ſee none, in ſuch circumſtances as might render it equally viſible to them and us.</p>
               <p>If they had ſeen it, it would appear in their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, there eſpecially where the Reaſon is thought to be moſt cogent, <hi>viz.</hi> in the adminiſtration of the Sacraments. It is preſumed, <note n="a" place="bottom">The Antient Churches, from the very firſt Century, did uſe ſuch publick wholeſome forms of ſound words, in their Sacramental Celebrations eſpecially, and afterwards in other Holy Adminiſtrations or publick Duties, as made up their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn, devout and publick Liturgies. <hi>D.

               <p>By preſcribed Forms are meant <hi>ſuch as are impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon the Adminiſtrator, ſo as thoſe muſt be uſed, and no other, nor otherwiſe, without adding, detract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or tranſpoſing.</hi> The Favourers of ſuch Forms ſuppoſe, they have been the conſtant uſage of the Church, every where, ever ſince extraordinary gifts ceaſed.

               <p>There was alſo ſome kind of Uniformity in their Sacramental Prayers; that is, a general agreement to pray for the ſame things, though not in the ſame words.

               <p>If there had been ſuch Liturgies antiently, as are contended for, and are now in uſe; Prayers would have been read then, as they are now. But <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>We meet not with any mention of ſuch Books, upon ſuch occaſions, where it might be expected they would be mentioned, if any where; and where we might juſtly look to find them, if they had been to be found.</p>

               <p>To aſcend a little higher; in the times of the Churches Perſecution, in the beginning of the fourth Age; if there had been ſuch Service Books, why did not their Perſecutors call for the delivery of them, as they did, not only for the Bible, but for other Church Utenſils?

               <p>Now if the exerciſe of the Chriſtian Worſhip, which lay, as is ſuppoſed, in the pretended Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, were as odious to the Heathen, as their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets concerning God and his Worſhip, which lay in the Bible; if there had been any ſuch Liturgies, why would not the <hi>Gentiles</hi> have been as zealous, to deſtroy them as the Scriptures?</p>
               <p>However it may well be ſuppoſed, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery of the Chriſtians Liturgies, if there had been any, would have been required, if not as much as that of their Bibles, yet more then that of their other Church Utenſils. <hi>Torti Prodoſis, Euſeb. l. 8. p.</hi> 242.

               <p>We ſee, they would not tolerate Heatheniſh Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies, differing from what they uſed only in Mode and Rites, though conformable as to the ſubſtance and object of their Worſhip. Would they not be more violent for the delivering up of Chriſtian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies, more oppoſite to them every way, if there had been any? But there's not a word, in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, of any ſuch demand, or any complyance therewith, or any cenſure of ſuch complyance; when the demand and delivery of other things leſs material, leſs offenſive to them, and proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt the <hi>Traditors,</hi> are frequently men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Auguſtine</hi> alleadges ſome things frequently pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for in publick, but not as in the words of any written Liturgy, but of the Adminiſtrator, <hi>Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do audis Sacerdotem Dei ad altare, &amp;c. Ep. 107. p.</hi> 567. And the ſame Petitions he afterwards ſets down in other words; which ſignifies, he had them not out of any preſcribed or written Liturgy; for then they (would, they) muſt have been the ſame; <hi>Pro incredulis, ut eos Deus convertat ad

               <p>
                  <hi>Auguſtine</hi> mentions the publick Prayers againſt <hi>Pelagians;</hi> but no otherwiſe, then as he might have alleadged the extemporary petitions of ſuch, who ſeeking the ſame things that Chriſtians uſually do, uſe not the ſame words; and agreeing in the ſubject, vary other ways in the expreſſions; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any intimation, that they were preſcribed or in variable Forms. And elſewhere with ſome note of uncertainty, whether they did ſo pray, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoſe were their words in publick; whereas if they had been in a common written Liturgy, he would have known it, and might have been poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; or ſome intimation of liberty they had to uſe thoſe words or not, thoſe or others; <hi>ſi volue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Finally, it cannot with any reaſon be ſuppoſed, but, if there had been ſuch Liturgies, they would have been made uſe of againſt the Errours, and for deciding the Controverſies, wherewith the Church was exerciſed in the Ages we are concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in. To wave others, there were two eſpecially as to which they might have been this way appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently ſerviceable; <hi>viz.</hi> That concerning the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of Chriſt, oppoſed in the firſt, ſecond, third and fourth Age eſpecially. And that concerning the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> of the faithful; and other errors, with which <hi>Pelagius</hi> and his adherents troubled the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in the beginning of the fifth Age, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. His Tenet ſee <hi>Auguſt. contr. 2 ep. Pelag. l. 4. c. 2. p.</hi> 239.</p>
               <p>None will fancy a Chriſtian Liturgy, wherein
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60923:13"/> there is not ſome acknowledgment of, or ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to Chriſt as God, or wherein there is not ſome confeſſion of ſin, or ſome petition for pardon, in Prayers proper to the faithful, ſomething equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent to petition in the Lords Prayer, forgive us our Treſpaſſes, and ſo no Liturgies, wherein there was not evidence enough againſt both thoſe errours, and others alſo of the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> inconſiſtent with the neceſſity of the grace of God.</p>
               <p>And it will be granted, that if thoſe who were judicious had the managing of thoſe Controverſies, if they thought it requiſite to make uſe of Humane Teſtimony, they would make choice of that which is moſt cogent and convictive.</p>

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60923:14"/> moſt judicious Writers that thoſe Ages afforded, make uſe of the Teſtimonies of their Predeceſſors and Contemporaries; but alledge not one paſſage out of a Service-Book, or any Prayers written, or ſo as to give us occaſion to think there were any ſuch uſed publickly, and authorized; whereas they could not but apprehend as well as we, that one clear allegation out of an antient and commonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Liturgy would have been more cogent and convictive, then any, or all the particular Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, they produce; (ſince the judgment of whole Churches, in ſeveral Ages too, is far more conſiderable, then of many particular perſons).</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and others alleadge, againſt the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagians,</hi> divers things, which were frequently pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for in publick; but without ſignifying in the leaſt wiſe, that the Prayers were written or anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, (which he in <hi>Euſebius</hi> thought it requiſite to expreſs, concerning the Hymns he mentions) or that they were generally received, or the ſame Form, or authorized for the publick Service, or preſcribed to be invariably uſed. Yet in theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars lay the force and the advantage of ſuch an allegation; and that which would render it moſt conſiderable, and of far more weight then the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of ſingle Writers: And therefore undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly would have been inſiſted on (if there had been any ſuch thing to urge) by any, who knew how to manage an Argument, or to make uſe of a very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious advantage.</p>
               <p>So that we may conclude, either the greateſt wits and judgments of thoſe times were not wiſe enough to diſcern the beſt advantages they had from
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60923:14"/> Humane Teſtimony, ſuch as were obvious to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry eye; and either could not manage them, as thoſe of ordinary capacities amongſt us can do; or would not improve them, as the intereſt of the truth they contended for, and their faithfulneſs to it required; and ſo were either injudicious or unfaithful; or elſe that they had no ſuch advantages to make uſe of, and ſo no ſuch Liturgies.</p>
               <p>Further, if there were ſuch Liturgies, how comes it to paſs, that we meet with no intelligence of any changing of them, or alterations made in them, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch occaſions, as we may well conceive would neceſſarily draw on ſuch changes, and in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility bring us ſome account thereof. <hi>Quiſquis un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam,</hi> ſays one, <hi>Religionem mutavit, &amp; orandi ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem mutavit: nulla unquam Haereſis fuit, quae non continuo ſuas eſſinxerit preces.

This being ſo, we may expect to meet with fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent mention of rejecting old Liturgies, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing new, of altering or correcting them, if the antient mode of Praying was by preſcribed Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies.

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60923:15"/> as much for the honour of Chriſt? Or can there be ſuppoſed a Liturgy, which had nothing in it for the honour of Chriſt <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And if he had made as bold with a Liturgy, would this have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed by thoſe Fathers, who are ſo large and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, in giving an account of all his impieties, innovations, preſumptions, (that the juſtice of their proceeding againſt him might be clear to the world), not omitting thoſe Hymns, which were of leſs mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Arrians</hi> ſo far prevailed, as they had poſſeſſed themſelves of all the publick Churches, in a great part of the Chriſtian World, the <hi>Eaſt</hi> eſpecially (ſo as the Orthodox, reduced to Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, were glad to keep them in private Houſes, Fields, Woods, or where elſe they could or durſt) they had power and opportunity to make what changes they would; and no leſs will and forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſhewing ſufficiently how much they were given to change, and that no reſpect would reſtrain from altering any thing, which croſt their tenet, by the alterations they made in the Doxology, in the words of Chriſt for adminiſtring Baptiſm, yea in the Scriptures themſelves, as <hi>Ambroſe</hi> tells us, <hi>de Spiritu Sancto.</hi> 3. 11. And remarkably in the univerſally received Confeſſion of Faith, ſince they made a new Creed almoſt every other year. <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> gives a particular account of three in little more then twenty years, <hi>Hiſt. lib. 4. c. 32. p.</hi> 604.</p>
               <p>And what could reſtrain this innovating humour (when they had power enough) from aboliſhing or altering the ſuppoſed Lituries, if they were but tempted to it, by what they would count a juſt
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60923:15"/> occaſion? And ſuch occaſion they had, if thoſe Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies contained any thing in favour of the Eternal Godhead of Chriſt, or his equality with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or the Divinity of the Holy Ghoſt (which the <hi>Semi-Arrians</hi> oppoſed). And ſome things (if not many) of this tendency they contained, if they were Chriſtian Liturgies. Why is it then, that we hear not a word of their changing any old Liturgy, or compoſing any new; when we hear of their making bold both with that of greater moment and leſs? And how is it that their Antagoniſts, who thought themſelves and their cauſe concerned, to give a full account of their innovations, (conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Novelties to be one of the great advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges they had againſt them, and improving it, by publiſhing them to the World) make no mention of any ſuch thing? In all reaſon this muſt be, becauſe there was no ſuch thing, no occaſion for it, no ſuch Liturgies then in faſhion.</p>
               <p>We hear alſo afterwards, when <hi>Eutychianiſm</hi> was prevailing, what a tumult was made in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> what a noiſe through the World by the adding of one word or two, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               <p>And could more changes be made in ſetled Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies (with whoſe Forms and Prayers the people are preſumed to have been as well acquainted, and longer accuſtomed to them, then to that Hymn) without any noiſe, without any notice?</p>
               <p>Certainly, if they had been aboliſhed, or ſuch alterations made in them, we ſhould have heard of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60923:16"/> it, ſome where or other. And if there were no changes made therein, upon ſo great changes of the Chriſtian Religion, it was becauſe there was none to be changed, no ſuch Liturgies extant.</p>
               <p>In general, that they had no ſuch publick Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies for the adminiſtration of the Sacraments, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by this; that they thought themſelves obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, with all care to conceal the Symbols, the Rites, the Prayers uſed in theſe adminiſtrations, from the ſight and knowledge of all that were not initiated.

               <p>I will not ſay, the Chriſtians imitated the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> herein, eſpecially if the practice began ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as <hi>Tertullian</hi> (which ſome ſuppoſe, becauſe he waves the mention of the Sacrament, when he had occaſion to give the Heathen an account there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, in ſuch circumſtances, as <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> before
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60923:19"/> him had plainly deſcribed it). For there is a great zeal viſible in his Writings againſt complyances with the Heathen. Yet will I not deny, but that this cuſtom amongſt the <hi>Gentiles</hi> might have ſome influence upon Chriſtians in after Ages; when it was thought a good expedient (how rightly experience afterwards ſhewed) for drawing the <hi>Pagans</hi> over to the, to meet them in ſome of their obſervances.

               <p>However, it is undeniable, that ſuch conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were in uſe amongſt them, and particularly as to the Prayers which were made in the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Sacraments, and ſome other Rites counted myſterious.</p>

As they had their <hi>myſteria chartis non committenda,</hi> in <hi>Origens</hi> phraſe; (<hi>in Ep. ad Rom. c.</hi> 2.) ſo theſe myſterious Prayers were to be kept as ſecret.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to uſe them as myſteries, no more then to recite them in their hearing. What they durſt not plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pronounce, they would not venture to write; according to that of <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus, ſtrom.</hi> 1. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> By this means they might come to the knowledge of Aliens. <hi>Ruffinus</hi> puts this in the account he gives, why the Creed was at firſt not written, (<hi>idcirco denique haec non ſcribi chartulis atque membranis</hi>) it was to be uſed as a watch-word, whereby they might know Friends from Foes, (<hi>interrogatus ſymbolum, prodat, ſi ſit hoſtis an Socius.</hi>) But if it had been written, and the Chriſtians got it by reading; the deſign might have been fruſtrated; for this way, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels might have got the word, <hi>hac ex lectione, quae interdum pervenire etiam ad infideles ſolet.</hi> Expoſ. in Symb. in Cypr. opera. p. 4.</p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:60923:21"/>
               <p>That which they would have kept ſecret, they did not commit to Writing, for the view or uſe of others. Therefore <hi>Baronius</hi> ſayes, the way of drawing up their <hi>literae formatae,</hi> was not in Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; becauſe they were concerned to keep it ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, leaſt it ſhould be counterfeited, <hi>exiſtimamus ejuſmodi formulam nequaquam ab eis fuiſſe ſcripto traditam—ſed penes Epiſcopos Catholicos retentam eſſe ſecretam.</hi> Ad an. 325. n. 44.</p>
               <p>And there wants not direct evidence, that they had not any Prayers thus writ. <hi>Baſil</hi> ſays ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, the words they uſed in bleſſing the Elements, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>It is no way probable, theſe Prayers and their other <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:60923:24"/> we may conclude, they had them not thus written, and conſequently they could have no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed Liturgies for the adminiſtration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.</p>
               <p>And the impoſſibility of concealment, will be more evident, if Liturgies were to be not only in the hands of the ſeveral Miniſters, Biſhops, Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, Deacons; but alſo in the peoples hands; as it was neceſſary they ſhould be, unleſs they were quite other things, then either the modern now im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, or the pretended antient Liturgies; for then the people bear ſuch a part in the Prayers, as ſhews their direction by a Book neceſſary. And ſome part they had of old, as appears by <hi>Cyril, Catech. my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtag.</hi> 5. And <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> in 2 <hi>Cor. hom. 18. p.</hi> 647. Though nothing ſo much, as in the written Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, nor what they might not have by cuſtom with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Book.</p>
               <p>This may ſuffice for the Sacraments in general, to ſhew how far thoſe that adminiſtred them were from being confined to preſcribed Forms.</p>
               <p>For the Euchariſt in particular, let us view the 23 Canon of the Third Council of <hi>Carthage: <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t nemo in precibus, vel Patrem pro Filio, vel Filium pro Patre nominet, &amp; cum ad altare aſſiſtitur, ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ad Patrem dirigetur oratio—&amp; quaſcunque ſibi preces aliquis deſcribit, non eis utatur, niſi prius eas cum inſtructioribus Fratribus contulerit.</hi> That no man, in Prayers, ſhall name, either the Father for the Son, or the Son for the Father. And when they are at the Altar, the Prayer ſhall always be direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Father. And what Prayers ſoever any
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:60923:24"/> ſhall copy out for himſelf, he ſhall not uſe them, unleſs he firſt debate them with his diſcreeter Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</p>
               <p>The middle Clauſe of this Canon evidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the Euchariſtical Prayers; the firſt and laſt reſpect both theſe, and the Prayers alſo in other parts of the adminiſtrations; each of them make it plain, that in thoſe times, they were not under any reſtraint by impoſed Forms.</p>
               <p>For the firſt. Thoſe, who in their Prayers na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Father for the Son, or the Son for the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, uſed not preſcribed Forms; for ſure the Church would not preſcribe what the Council for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids. And as they uſed none before, ſo theſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers leave them at liberty, for the future, to uſe what they thought fit, only impoſing this on them, not to name the Father for the Son, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the next Clauſe. If no prayers were uſed, in the adminiſtration of this Sacrament, but what were preſcribed by the Church (and conſequently allowed by the Synod, as duely directed already) it was vain and ridiculous, to make ſuch an Order, <hi>ut ſemper ad Patrem,</hi> that the prayers be alwayes directed to the Father. This is clearly a reſtraint upon thoſe, who before had liberty, in celebrating this Ordinance, to addreſs their prayers to any Perſon of the Sacred Trinity; ordering that from henceforth they ſhould direct ſuch prayers only to the Father. And as it clearly ſuppoſes, they were neither limited nor directed, by any preſcribed Forms before; ſo it leaves them free, to uſe what prayers they judged meet, <hi>cum ad altare aſſiſtitur,</hi>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:60923:25"/> provided that they were addreſſed only to the Father.</p>
               <p>Yea the weaker and indiſcreeter ſort, of thoſe that officiated, are allowed, by the next Clauſe, to uſe what prayers they would any where make choice of, with this limitation only, that their more diſcreet Brethren ſhould firſt be conferred with about them. That of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> who was a great part of the <hi>African</hi> Councils, at this time, <hi>de Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm. contra Donat. l. 6. c. 25. p.</hi> 568. is the beſt Comment, which can be deſired, upon this paſſage. Having ſhewed, that divers of his Brethren had many things againſt the Faith, in prayers which they uſed in Sacramental adminiſtrations; he gives this account of it; <hi>Multi irruunt in pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Here we have perſons as fit to be confined to preſcribed Forms, as any we can expect to meet with; (ſuch as could neither make prayers themſelves, nor make tolerable choice of prayers made by others; being ſo ignorant, as they could not diſcern an Heretical prayer, when they met with it). Theſe are circumſtances, which might juſtifie the impoſition of ſet forms, if any could do it. And yet the <hi>African</hi> Fathers <note n="k" place="bottom">

But the wiſdom of <hi>Africa,</hi> and the great <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> thought that courſe more adviſeable, which is utterly inconſiſtent with ſuch reſtraint, and which left the moſt inſufficient of their Miniſters at greater liberty; for ſuch evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is the courſe they take in this Canon.

               <p>But 2.

               <p>As to the ſecond, the general Prayer, that this was not made in a ſet and invariable form, appears by the Epiſtle of <hi>Epiphanius</hi> to <hi>John</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> in <hi>Jeromes</hi> the 60. <hi>p.</hi> 466. There was ſome claſhing betwixt theſe two Biſhops; he of <hi>Cyprus</hi> being a great zealot againſt <hi>Origen;</hi> (as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> found by troubleſome experience). And he of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> being an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of <hi>Origen,</hi> and under ſuſpicion to be tainted with his erroneous Opinions. <hi>John</hi> had heard, that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> ſhould intimate, in the Euchariſtical Prayers, that he by name was warped from the Faith; he complains of it; and that Epiſtle is <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi>'s Anſwer and Apology, in reference to this and other particulars he was charged with. As to this, he admires, that any ſhould report, <hi>quod in oratione quando offerimus ſacrificia Deo, ſoleamus pro te dicere, Domine praeſta Johanni ut recte credat.</hi> This is the occaſion. And hereby it evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, they uſed occaſional Petitions in this Prayer; for ſuch a Petition is that complained of; and the occaſion a ſuſpicion, that <hi>John</hi> was inclined to <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gens</hi> errours. If ſuch liberty had never been uſed, to pray in this place as occaſion required, who would have been ſo impudent, as to raiſe ſuch a report; or ſo fooliſh as to affirm what none would believe, as being againſt the conſtant and unvariable cuſtom of thoſe that celebrated? Who can think, that the Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> would have brought ſuch a charge againſt <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> as would have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared falſe to the World at firſt ſight, and might have been convicted of impudent ſlander, by the known unalterable uſage of Chriſtians? And why does not he, who deſigned to burthen his Adverſary as much as might be, charge him with tranſgreſſing
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:60923:33"/> the orders of the Church, to vent his particular ſpleen at a Chriſtian Biſhop? Is it not evident upon the whole, that there were no ſuch orders, confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to any unvariable form, in that admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration; but that they might, and did, vary in their expreſſions, as there was occaſion.</p>
               <p>This will yet further appear, by <hi>Epiphanius's</hi> anſwer. <hi>Noli nos in tantum putare Ruſticos, ut hoc tam aperte dicere poterimus, &amp;c.</hi> He takes no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that what was objected, was inconſiſtent with the cuſtom and practice of that Church, and ſo groundleſly ſuggeſted. He appeales not to the known form, to which they were preciſely confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, refers him not to their Service Book for his ſatisfaction; which yet, if there had been any ſuch thing, a duller perſon then <hi>Epiphanius</hi> would have diſcovered, to have been the beſt way, to ſtop the mouth of his Accuſer. He denyes not, but they ordered their Prayers according to ſuch occaſions; but only tells him, they were not ſo ruſtical, as to do it ſo bluntly.</p>
               <p>We have, in the Engliſh Service Book, a Prayer for the whole ſtate of Chriſts Church, pretended to be anſwerable to this Prayer we are upon; and indeed the only Prayer in the Book, that can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to any footſteps of Antiquity, ſo high as the fourth Age. Now ſuppoſe the Biſhop of <hi>L.</hi> ſhould be accuſed, in that prayer to prefer ſuch a petition for the Primate of <hi>Ireland, Domine praeſta I., ut recte credat;</hi> what courſe would the Biſhop take, to clear himſelf of this accuſation? Would not the dulleſt of his Chaplains appeal to the prayer it ſelf, being invariably uſed, as the beſt way to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:60923:34"/> the charge was falſe; which yet the Biſhop of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> ſuppoſed to be juſt in the ſame circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, did not offer at? Nay he denies not, <hi>&amp;c. ut ſupra.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But let us proceed with his anſwer; <hi>quando au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem complemus orationem ſecundum ritum myſterio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, &amp; pro omnibus, &amp; pro te quoque dicimus, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtodi illum qui praedicat veritatem.

It is but one article of this prayer he gives an account of. It is the ſame thing (preaching the truth) and the ſame perſons, (thoſe that preached) he is telling us they prayed for. And they prayed but for the ſame perſons and things once in the ſame prayer; and yet he cannot tell de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminately what words they uſed, as appears evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, by his disjunction <hi>vel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now <hi>Epiphanius</hi> celebrated the Euchariſt himſelf thrice a week, as he thought by Apoſtolical order; ſo he tells us, <hi>expoſ. fidei,</hi> p. 110. <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>And if he had celebrated it in a ſet form, could he have been to ſeek for the words he uſed ſo often? ſince if either his Memory, or the Prayer-Book
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:60923:34"/> would have helped him; and one of them would have helpt him to the preciſe words, if they had then confined themſelves to any, and had had their Prayers either by heart or in a book; he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have writ ſo doubtfully of them, when his buſineſs was to ſatisfie a captious Adverſary.</p>
               <p>Would there be any need, for one who has the prayer for all ſtates by heart, or has the Service-Book before him, to expreſs by a diſtinction, what is there deſired for Biſhops, Paſtors and Curates? No more would <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> if the ſame mode of praying had been then in uſe.</p>

               <p>Hereby I ſuppoſe it clear enough, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all endeavours to obſcure it; that the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Prayer, in the moſt ſolemn part of publick Worſhip, in thoſe times, was no preſcribed Form. Nor was it any ſuch Form Two Hundred Years after, as appears by that of <hi>Baſil;</hi> who tells us plainly (in the latter end of the fourth Age) that no words of ſuch a Prayer were left in writing by any Holy Men. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </note>? By this it is evident, they were ſo far from having any preſcribed Forms, in Conſecrating the Euchariſt, as they had not ſo much as the words of any ſuch Form in Writing,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:60923:39"/> to his time, who lived, according to <hi>Petavius,</hi> till 379.</p>
               <p>It will be eaſily granted, by the Zealots for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed adminiſtrations, that there never was any Liturgy, wherein there was not a Form for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration (ſince they think any part of a Liturgy may be more tolerably omitted then this; and thoſe that officiate had better be left at liberty any where, then here) and they will ſhew us ſuch a Form, in all Liturgies extant, Modern or Antient, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be Antient) therefore they cannot reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably deny, while there were no ſuch Forms in Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, there were no ſuch Liturgies; and ſo none in <hi>Baſils</hi> time.</p>
               <p>By this alſo we may diſcern, what ſentence ought to be paſſed upon thoſe Liturgies, which go under the names, of <hi>Peter, Mark, James, Clemens</hi> and <hi>Baſil</hi> himſelf too.

And there we have (as a moſt neceſſary part of them) the Form of Conſecration in Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; which, he ſayes, no Holy Man ever left in Writing.</p>
               <p>In that, aſcribed to him, the forgery is more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent.

               </p>
               <p>Particularly, it was inquired, what place in the Euchariſtical office ſhould be aſſigned to the <hi>oſculum pacis;</hi> whether <hi>ante,</hi> or <hi>poſt confecta myſteria,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore or after the Conſecration of the Elements.

               <p>The liberty the Antients took, to uſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Forms in Baptiſm, with great variety, to the invariable uſe of which, thoſe, that are for freedom in Praying, are willingly confined; ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies they uſed as much liberty in thoſe Prayers.</p>
               <p>I can find no more uniformity, in their Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating this Sacrament, then the other. But
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:60923:49"/> enough may be eaſily found, to ſhew, that they were not, they would not be, tyed up to words and ſyllables.

Where ſure, if any where, they would have been patient of confinement to all puncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lios.

                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:60923:55"/> Syllables; nor yet have I met with two inſtances, where the difference is not more than Syllabical: It may be others may meet with more; yet if

               </p>
               <p>Now, if in ſo ſhort a ſentence as this, and that univerſally uſed in ſome terms or other, with a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral harmony as to the ſenſe, and wherein alſo there is nothing of Prayer, and ſo none of that
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:60923:56"/> reaſon which there is for freedom in Praying, they were not limited, nor did tie themſelves to a Sett of Words: Who can believe they were, or would have ſuffered themſelves to be confined to an unva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable Form of words, in Praying at Baptiſm?</p>

The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, as he perſonates them, gave liberty to wave their own ſuppoſed Forms, and think it well enough, if Prayers to the ſame purpoſe be uſed inſtead thereof. In all probability, if this Actor had laid his Scene in places and times, where more reſtraint had been tolerable, he would have repreſented it otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>But there needs no other evidence, for this liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in Baptiſmal Prayers, to any who are willing to ſee, than that in <hi>Auguſtin, de Bapt. contra Donat.</hi> l. 6. c. 25. where, examining the Allegations of the ſeveral Biſhops in the Council under <hi>Cyprian,</hi> to <hi>Sedatus</hi> of <hi>Tuburbis,</hi> who pleads thus for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptizing of thoſe Baptized by Hereticks; <hi>in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum aqua, ſacerdotis prece, in eccleſia ſanctificata ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luit peccata, in tantum Haeretico ſermone, velut can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere infecta, cumulat peccata:</hi> As the Water, by the Prayer of the Prieſt, in the Church is Sanctified to the waſhing away of ſin; ſo by an Heretical Prayer, as by a Cancer, it is infected, to the increaſing of ſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Auguſtin</hi> Anſwers, <hi>Si non ſanctificatur aqua, cum aliqua erroris verba per imperitiam precator effundit, multi non ſolum mali, ſet etiam boni fratres in ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſia
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:60923:58"/> non ſanctificant aquam.</hi> If the Water be not Sanctified when he that Prayes, through unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſs, utters ſome erroneous words; then, not only many evil, but good Brethren, in the Church do not ſanctifie the Water. <hi>Multorum enim preces emendantur quotidie, ſi doctioribus fuerint recitatae, &amp; multa in iis reperiuntur contra Catholicam fidem.</hi> For the Prayers of many are daily amended, if they be recited to the more Learned, and many things are found in them contrary to the Catholick Faith; (they were <hi>vitioſae preces, &amp; in quibus aliquid per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſum,</hi> as he afterwards.) Now ſuch prayers can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſuppoſed to have been any common Forms, commanded, or uſed, much leſs preſcribed by the Church. The courſe taken to redreſs this, was not a total prohibition of the Prayers they had choſen; nor the tying of ſuch Miniſters to the uſe of any common Form; no nor the commending of any ſuch to their uſe: But (what divers Synods (of which before) had decreed) the Prayers, which ſuch indiſcreet perſons made choice of, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited to the more learned, were by them amended, and the errors being left out, they are left to uſe them ſtill, (for the amending of them cannot be otherwiſe interpreted, than in order to future uſe:) And this courſe, as it is inconſiſtent with the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of any ſet Forms, ſo it argues forcibly, the Churches then had not in the adminiſtration of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, ſo much as any common Form in free uſe; otherwiſe, inſtead of daily trouble to others and themſelves, about correcting their very faulty Prayers; Why are not perſons ſo intolerably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreet (who could not diſcern when a Prayer was Heretical) ſo much as adviſed to make uſe of the common Form? And finally, under what reſtraint
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:60923:59"/> can any fancy the more diſcreet and learned to have been in Baptizing; when the weakeſt and moſt imprudent had ſo much liberty therein? Nothing needs be more manifeſt, than that neither the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent nor indiſcreet, were then confined to preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed Forms in the Miniſtration of Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>And thus we have made it ſufficiently evident, that in the Antient Church, the order for Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring the Sacraments (the Prayers eſpecially uſed in their Conſecration) were not preſcribed; nor the Adminiſtrators thereof under any ſuch reſtraint, as later and worſe times thought fit for them. I might indeavour to give the like ſatisfaction con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning other parts of Worſhip, which were Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred by Prayers; and might do it now with more eaſe than this already done. But it is not needful, ſince thoſe, who ſhew the greateſt paſſion for the Forms in queſtion, affirm, that in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they were and are moſt neceſſary, and were firſt there uſed; and ſo muſt acknowledge, that when they were not in uſe there, they were no where uſed, nor any where counted needful: And beſides, this Diſcourſe grows long, (and ſo may be tedious) beyond what I expected or deſigned. I will therefore only add ſome few teſtimonies, which give evidence againſt ſuch Forms in general, and will reach the particulars, as therein involved; eaſing my ſelf and others thereby of a tedious and ſuperfluous labour.</p>

Now certainly, the<note place="margin">Chryſoſt. in Eph.

They were perſons ordinarily of greateſt abilities amongſt the Chriſtians. When ordinary Chriſtians were ſuperiour to the Paſtors of after times, they wanted not the knowledge of Divine things, nor the ſenſe of their Spiritual condition, or their Peoples, nor a faculty to expreſs tolerably what they knew and felt. They were not beſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by intemperance, nor had loſt the uſe of their faculties for want of exerciſe, nor were their gifts ſhrivled up by a curſe, becauſe they did not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy them: They had ability to frame their own Prayers, as well as to make their own Sermons; and if they confined themſelves to Prayers made by others, they did not give Thanks and Pray, as the Holy Martyr ſays they did, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, according to their ability, or as they were able. The phraſe hath been ſufficiently vindicated before; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it here occurs again, let this be added for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſatisfaction. It is ſaid, that it denotes not the exerciſe of abilities for Prayer, but earneſtneſs in Praying, neither leſs nor more: But this is only ſaid, without any proof, without any inſtance where it is ſo taken, either in <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

               <p>Let us proceed; That of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> Apol. 1. c. 30. <hi>ſine monitore, quia de pectore oramus,</hi> hath

(How reaſonably may be conſidered elſewhere;) and this ſhews, it is not for want of evidence in the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that this ſenſe of it is ſince rejected by his followers, but from ſomething elſe. I doubt not, but if it would have been ſerviceable another way, there would be no queſtion, but this was <hi>Septimius</hi>'s meaning, the Chriſtians did Pray without any ſuch Prompter, as the Heathen, becauſe their hearts were their Prompters: or, as Biſhop <hi>Bilſon,</hi> becauſe they Pray as their hearts move them.

                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:60923:64"/> here derides them. This cannot be denied, it ſeems; yet, which is the only ſhift left them, <hi>de Pectore,</hi> they will have to be no more than ſaying their Prayers by heart.</p>

               <p>So that all along it is manifeſt, the uniformity aimed at, in the common preſcribed Liturgies, was only the iſſue and darling of late, dark and degenerate times; an innovation upon the Churches uſages, in better times, and an invading of her Antient Liberty; for which the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> were the greateſt Zealots, deſigning therein the ſubjection of all other Churches to that of <hi>Rome;</hi> and gaining thereby, both an acknowledgment of the Papal Authority, from thoſe who ſubmitted to this Yoke, and an advantage of diffuſing the Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of her Superſtitions, through the body of the Weſtern Empire, where uniformity in Liturgy and Rituals, became a chief part of the uniform Apoſtaſie of the latter times.</p>

               <p n="2">2. Undoubtedly they would have been general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admitted, as other Apoſtolical Writings were. None would have ſeen reaſon, to have compoſed other Liturgies, nor would any other have been preferred before them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Finally, none would have preſumed, or would have been ſuffered without controul, to have inlarged, curtailed, inverted them, and made all kind of alrerations therein, as ſome have done, ſo as they are quite transformed from what they were once; inſomuch as their Favourers can ſhew us no one part of them, which may with any aſſurance be aſcribed to the firſt Authors, whoever they were. This is acknowledged, and ſaid to be done in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Ages, by the Guides of thoſe Churches, where they had entertainment: Who by thus uſing them, evidently declared, either that they did not believe them to be Apoſtolical, nor would have had them ſo accounted; or elſe, that themſelves were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious wretches, in making ſo bold with that which ſhould have been preſerved inviolable as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and wretched Impoſtors too, who would thruſt their own patches, and others no better than their own, upon Chriſtians, under Apoſtolical names: And ſo, one of theſe ways, all the credit is loſt, upon which they are recommended to the World as Apoſtolical.</p>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:60923:78"/>
               <p>But, if they were not known (as is manifeſt by the premiſſes they were not) for ſo many Ages; then, neither were they extant, and ſo, owe not their Original to the Apoſtles, or any near their times. For it is impoſſible, that, if they had been extant, and compoſed by the Apoſtles, for the conſtant and daily uſe of the Churches, they ſhould not be known to the generality of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, ſuppoſed to have ſo uſed them: Or, if any will ſay, the Churches uſed them not, he muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them as highly impious, living in willful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to the Apoſtles orders, and open con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of their Authority, from Generation to Generation: And further, if they were not known to be Apoſtolical, before the Seventh or Eighth Ages, there's no way left to know it after. Innate Arguments there are none, in thoſe pieces, to evidence it, but many which ſhew the contrary; no features or lineaments truly Apoſtolical, but much of the ſcurf and luxuriouſneſs of corrupt and decrepit Ages. So that there is nothing but teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to rely on; and he that will admit writings to be Apoſtolical, upon the teſtimony of times, wherein deluſion and degeneracy prevailed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt atteſtation of the Firſt Churches, and ſo many intermediate Ages, is well diſpoſed to be deluded, or delude others.</p>

When the Papiſt reaſoneth after this manner, Sure the Apoſtles had ſome preciſe Form of Service, tho' we know it not; the reply is to them: Since you know it not, why make you it your Anchor-hold, ſeeing what the Apoſtles did obſerve, none would have dared, but have obſerved it, after their example?</p>
                  </note> who alledge them,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:60923:78"/> did know any Prayers, in that of <hi>James,</hi> or the reſt, which they really believed to be Apoſtolical, they would uſe thoſe themſelves, they would imploy their Authority and Intereſt to have them uſed by others; they would not be ſo arrogant, as to think their own models, or ſo weak, as to judge the Forms of others better; or ſo perverſe, as to make choice of the worſe; they would not ſhew ſuch contempt of the Apoſtles, as to preferr others before them; or ſuch diſobedience, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to obſerve what they preſcribed. All the writings of the Apoſtles (they being univerſal Officers, divinely Inſpired) oblige all; ſo that I ſee not what room there is for excuſe, unleſs they will ſay, that tho' the Apoſtles compoſed theſe Liturgies, yet they did not injoyn the uſe of them, but left it arbitrary, impoſing on none. Yet even thus, tho' there be leſs diſobedience, there is no leſs contempt. For thoſe that will have Prayers of others compoſing uſed, when there is alſo choice of them; Do they not offer an affront to the Apoſtles, with the aggravations forementioned, if they neglect theirs, and uſe and impoſe others?</p>
               <p>And if the Apoſtles did not injoyn the uſe of their ſuppoſed Liturgies, nor would impoſe them on any, Why are they not imitated herein? Why, having leſs Authority, (to ſay nothing of Wiſdom) do our Liturgiſts take more upon them, than the Apoſtles would do, in impoſing on thoſe, whom they thought beſt to leave free; and imperiouſly preſcribing their own weak inventions, or others, weaker and worſe than their own, when the Apoſtles, Divinely Inſpired, did not ſo much as adviſe the uſe of their ſuppoſed Forms?</p>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:60923:79"/>
               <p>But if they do not know, nor really believe, (as the premiſſes perſwade me they do not) that thoſe Forms and Prayers, or any of them, are the Apoſtles; Is it ingenuous to offer that for proof, which they do not themſelves believe?</p>
               <p>Let us then leave them to thoſe who can believe them, which I ſhall wonder if any can, but thoſe who have a Faith at Command, (when it will ſerve a turn) wide enough to ſwallow a <hi>Jacobus de Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragine</hi> without mincing.</p>
               <p>If I have ſtayed the longer here, they will, I hope, bear with me, who tender the honour of the Apoſtles, and of the Divine and Infallible Spirit, to whoſe inſpirations we owe all their writings; and would not have them lie under the unſufferable reproach, of having ſuch deformed Brats fathered on them; which indeed were the iſſue of darkneſs and degeneracy, and the Ages wherein thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed; but borrowed thoſe great and ſacred names, to hide their ſhame, and gain them reputation, in a World much under the power of deluſion, where alone it was to be hoped for.</p>
               <p>Thus we have cleared the firſt Three hundred Years after Chriſt, from all ſuſpicion of Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping God publickly, in the way under debate; having examined all that is alledged, either for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed or arbitrary Forms; and finding nothing of weight therein, to ſway a diſintereſſed perſon, to believe there was any ſuch thing, or to procure the aſſent of any, but thoſe who are diſpoſed to yield it without proof: And ſince that is not found to have been the way of the Three Firſt Ages of Chriſtianity, it is not very conſiderable, nor ſcarce worth the inquiry, in what times elſe this may be found, a way of worſhipping God in publick Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:60923:79"/> for which there is nothing in the Apoſtles writings or practice, or in the practice of the Firſt Churches, and thoſe after them for Three hundred Years; and ſo, neither rule, nor reaſon, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, in the beſt and moſt imitable Ages; where alſo, their way of Worſhipping is deſerted, who ſerved God moſt regularly and acceptably: If it find any thing to excuſe it, it will have nothing to commend it to any, unleſs we will admit thoſe of ſuch Palates to be our Taſters, who like a Puddle better than either the Spring or the Streams while they run any thing clear.</p>
               <p>In the two next Ages, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, things grew worſe and worſe, <hi>Chryſ. in 1 Cor. Hom.</hi> p. 277. as he tells us, who reſolutely ſet himſelf againſt the Stream of the then prevailing corruptions, but found it too violent for him, and warned others by what beſel him, that to ſtrive againſt it, was the way to be ſunk. Thoſe, who have no great affection for theſe Liturgies, will not envy them the honour of having their riſe in ſuch degeneracy, as the beſt Writers of thoſe days ſaw ſo much cauſe to lament. The chief, if not the only ornament of thoſe times, were thoſe great perſons, who had ſuch reaſon to complain thereof. And many there were excellently accompliſhed, in the Fourth Age, and ſome till about the middle of the Fifth. It may ſeem ſomething for the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of theſe Liturgies, if they can be found in the Church, while there was any thing of ſuch eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in it; let us therefore view what is produced, as a diſcovery thereof.</p>
               <p>The Eighteenth Canon of the Council of <hi>Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicea</hi> is alledged for preſcribed Liturgies, <hi>p. 374. Titulus in Crab. de Orationibus quotidianis,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Hence it is argued, The ſame Prayers are to be uſed, both at <hi>Nones</hi> and <hi>Veſpers;</hi> therefore Forms of Prayer are impoſed. But this is a very lame inference; for, neither is the Conſequence good, neither is the Antecedent true.</p>
               <p>The inconſequence is apparent, ſince the ſame Prayers may be uſed often, and yet not the words thereof preſcribed or impoſed. We have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances enough, to clear this, in our Pulpits; where many, before their Sermons, and after, uſe the ſame Prayers Morning and Evening, whereas none preſcribe the words, or impoſe thoſe Forms on them, but themſelves. And ſo we might diſmiſs this Canon, as making nothing for preſcribed Forms. If this Synod would have had the ſame Prayers uſed; yet here's not a Syllable for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing the words thereof, or injoyning what Forms ſhould be uſed.</p>
               <p>But indeed here's nothing to ſignifie, that it was the intent of the Synod, to have the ſame Prayers uſed, at the times ſpecified; neither the whole phraſe (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) nor any word in it imports ſuch a thing; and they make the Fathers abſurd, who fix ſuch a ſenſe on their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> will not ſerve the turn; for it does not here (as in later times) ſignifie a Book or Model of preſcribed and ſtinted Forms of Prayer, and other Adminiſtrations. Indeed, as ſome Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, where they meet with this word, conclude they have found their Maſs; ſo others, when they
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:60923:80"/> find it, may fancy they have diſcovered a Service-Book: But both ridiculouſly, to thoſe who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Antient uſe of the word.</p>
               <p>For, no inſtance hath yet been produced, nor can be, wherein it is uſed in this ſenſe, by any of the Antients, before this Council, or long after: And therefore none will believe it is ſo taken here, but ſuch, whoſe deſire to have it ſo, will ſerve for reaſon enough to believe it.</p>

               <p>Only I muſt not forget, that ſome make an offer at the Liturgies, which go under the names of <hi>Baſil</hi> and <hi>Chryſostom;</hi> as tho' theſe would help their cauſe.

                  </q> Indeed the Romaniſts are the great ſticklers, for the Legitimation of theſe Miſſals, ſeeing them full of thoſe ſores, which they count the beauty of their Church.

Only ſome, very loth quite to loſe the advantages they would make of them, are willing to ſupppoſe, that tho' they have ſuffered very great changes, by additions, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polations, inverſions, ſubſtractions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing may yet remain therein of <hi>Baſil</hi>'s and <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom</hi>'s.

If ſuch groundleſs ſurmizes may be admitted, no Brat, tho' evidently ſpurious, but will procure a Legitimation, in part at leaſt, if any can expect thereby to ſerve a turn; a way is hereby opened, for an equal defence of the moſt impudent and pernicious forgeries, that the Church hath been peſtered with. Some will be apt to ſuppoſe the like of the Liturgies, Fathered upon <hi>Peter, James, Mark,</hi> and all the Apoſtles, in their pretended Conſtitutions.

It's true, thoſe Goſpels were not received by the firſt Churches, but that makes no difference; ſince neither were thoſe Liturgies received by them, no nor known, or mentioned, as we ſhewed before, (and ſo not extant) till many Hundred years after the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles times; and upon this account, their pretence to Apoſtolicalneſs, is more ridiculous than that of the other.

And ſo, if this ſhift were honeſt, and ſafe, and reaſonable; yet is it wholly unſerviceable for the proof of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed Liturgies. To be brief, It is manifeſt, in the genuine Writings of both thoſe Fathers, that they judged it neceſſary, to conceal and keep ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret the Sacramental Rites and Prayers (which is all that is conſiderable in thoſe Liturgies) from all but the Communicants: Now, they did not take the courſe to conceal, but divulge them, if they writ and publiſhed thoſe Liturgies, tho' but for the common uſe of the Province or Dioceſs, where each of them preſided; and therefore, ſince we cannot conceive, that they would run counter to their declared principles, it cannot be believed, that they were the Authors and divulgers of thoſe, or any other ſuch Liturgies, or of any ſuch Prayers in them; and conſequently, it is injurious to them, to Father theſe Miſſals (if they were not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſo Leprous, and every way unlike them) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe Worthies.</p>

It is recorded of each of theſe perſons, ſignally and peculiarly, that they introduced a new mode and order of Singing, into the reſpective Churches, where they preſided, never there uſed before. <hi>Baſil</hi>'s new <hi>Pſalmody,</hi> brought in by him to <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> was made more remarkable, by the offence taken thereat by the Clergy of <hi>Neocaeſarea,</hi> as an innovation in the Worſhip of God: He defends it, and gives an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count what it was, <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 63. <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>But, if I minded not the diſcovery of the truth, more than upholding of my opinion, or diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of yours; I would grant, that by <hi>Ordo</hi> is underſtood a Liturgy with preſcribed Prayers; and it would be a great diſadvantage to your cauſe, to grant it; for here's a plain ſignification, they had no ſuch Liturgy before, and the Original hereof from Six Biſhops, in one Province of <hi>France,</hi> where Fifteen or Seventeen, and this not till the latter end of the Fifth Age, when all <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>And this is all, which I can find alledged in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of theſe Liturgies for Five hundred Years after Chriſt, that is conſiderable, unleſs the Hymns <hi>Benedicite</hi> and <hi>Te Deum</hi> may be counted worthy of conſideration: And ſo perhaps they may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted, if not otherwiſe, yet in reſpect of the Perſons, that ſo make uſe of them.</p>
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:60923:90"/>
               <p>But the inference is not good, from Forms of Hymns to Forms of Prayer; much leſs from arbitrary Forms of Hymns, to preſcribed Forms of Prayer, or Liturgies. Hymns are more elaborate, require more Art and Ornament than Prayers: and therefore, thoſe who are not for ſet Forms of Prayer, if they admit Hymns of humane and ordinary compoſition, ſee reaſon to have them in Forms, and not without preme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation. And their Oppoſites will not deny them here more needful.</p>
               <p>Nor will the Inference hold, from preſcribed Hymns to preſcribed Liturgies, from a ſmall part (for which there is a different reaſon) to the whole <hi>Ex. Gr.</hi> If <hi>Nicephorus</hi> his report were true, <hi>lib. 14. cap.</hi> 46. that <hi>Theodoſius</hi> Junior, with his Siſter <hi>Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheria,</hi> injoyned the <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>As for thoſe two Hymns alledged, there is no evidence, that they were impoſed, or ſo much as uſed, in any time, which will ſerve to prove the Antiquity of thoſe Liturgies, which is pretended, or any which is for their reputation.

                  </note> that there was no ſuch thing, as that for which they are alledged. To me there needs no more Arguments, nor (if I much miſtake not) will more be very needful to any other, whoſe minds are not prepoſſeſſed with ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing too hard for their reaſon. For if there had been ſuch Liturgies uſed conſtantly in all Churches through the World, for Five hundred or Six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Years next after Chriſt, it is not imaginable, but there would have been ſuch remarkable traces,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:60923:92"/> yea ſuch clear evidence in ſome, yea in many of the Antients (eſpecially the Writers being ſo nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, their Writings left us ſo full and Volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous, and the occaſions of mentioning them ſo very frequent) that there might have been had as full and clear proof thereof, and with as much eaſe, as of any one thing, whoſe antiquity hath been queſtioned. Now, when many have curiouſly ſearched antiquity for this, and being prickt on by oppoſition, have purſued the ſearch with great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, under a quick ſenſe too how much they are concerned herein, and being withal, Perſons of as great ability for the diſcovery, as any we can expect will attempt it, divers of them ſeeming as well acquainted with what is obvious in antiquity (which is all that is needful in this caſe) as with their own Lodgings, and ſome of them no ſtrangers to her in her Retirements and leſs traced Receſſes; after they have, (as they tell us, and we might have believed it, if they had not ſaid ſo) made the faireſt proof thereof they can, yet produce nothing, which any that are impartial can account, or which I am apt to think they themſelves can believe to be ſufficient proof, (if their belief were beholding to nothing but their reaſon:) May it not be hence reaſonably concluded, that what, in theſe circumſtances, is not now diſcovered, was not then extant? Such Liturgies uſed every where, for ſo many Hundred years, are a matter of that nature, which would have been obvious at a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial view, and of eaſie proof to ſuch as have no intimate acquaintance with antiquity.
